# 📰 Fake News Detection using Machine Learning

## 📌 Project Overview

Fake News Detection is a **Machine Learning**-based project that aims to classify whether a given news article is *genuine* or *fake*. The primary focus is on applying **Natural Language Processing (NLP)** techniques along with supervised learning models to analyze the text data and predict the authenticity of news content.

This project is ideal for college students and researchers looking to implement **text classification** problems using ML.

## 🛠️ Project Workflow

1. **Data Collection**
   - Dataset contains news articles with labels (`real`, `fake`)
   - Source: Kaggle

2. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**
   - Removing punctuation, stopwords, and special characters
   - Tokenization and Lemmatization using `nltk`

3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
   - Word clouds, frequency distributions
   - Fake vs Real distribution graphs

4. **Text Vectorization**
   - TF-IDF Vectorizer
   - Bag-of-Words (optional)

5. **Model Training**
   - Trained on 80% data
   - Tested on 20% data
   - Cross-validation applied

6. **Model Evaluation**
   - Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
   - Confusion matrix and ROC Curve

7. **Output**
   - Predicts if a given news is real or fake
   - Deployment-ready ML pipeline
